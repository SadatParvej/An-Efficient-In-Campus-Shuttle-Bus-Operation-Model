# An Efficient In-Campus Shuttle Bus Operation Model
This model is developed by taking a certain area as a whole university campus.


Tool used to create the map: "geojson.io" powered by mapbox.
Language used for setting up the map: python.


Instructions for setting up the model:
1. Extract the zip file. It is a folder that contains the dummy map of the 'North South University' campus and routes.Rename      the folder as "NSU mapping".
2. Upload the folder into a google drive.
3. Download the file named "Shuttle_Bus_Service.ipynb" and open it with google colab book.
